# Gauss_seidel_and_jacobi_implementation
This project implements the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations. These numerical techniques are widely used for solving large sparse linear systems, commonly found in engineering and scientific computing.

#Features

Implementation of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods

Supports any square system of linear equations

Iterative approach for convergence to the solution

Configurable convergence criteria and iteration limits

Comparison of both methods in terms of speed and accuracy
